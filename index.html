  <p>I am Isabela “Jesucia LaLoba” Figueroa, a 29-year-old native from El Barrio (East Harlem), New York City.<br/> I am a mother. I am a lonely girl. I am biracial/multiethnic queer woman. I am a spiritual being; I am an Aries.<br/> I am an artist who is scared to produce their art; <i>i</i> Am Art. I am Queen of the (bathroom) mirror selfies.<br/> I am a lover: hopeless romantic. I am a cynic: judgmental hater.<br/> I am crippled by my anxieties and fears, yet in love with the messiness of what it means to be human; I <i>am</i> human.<br/> My work is about as confusing as I am, but power does lay somewhere in there even if my pen/voice shakes.</p>
  <p>Jesucia LaLoba was born in the part of my mind that feels strong about itself (occasionally and randomly).<br/> Since the inception of LaLoba, she goes back and forth between fighting the power and hiding under a rock.<br/> She is deeply passionate about bodily autonomy, equitable society, and of course, alluring aesthetics.<br/> Jesucia LaLoba: the saintly sinner.<br/> She <i>is</i> human.</p>
