  <p>When my family received our first digital camera, my friends and I would constantly take pictures, mainly of ourselves, to show case our top model skills (this was when America’s Next Top Model was thee show to watch). We wanted to feel like we could be in magazines or on billboards, and much of that has stuck with me as I’ve grown up taking photos.<br/></p>
<p>Much like the 15th century artists who began painting detailed self-portraits, I too wanted to document elaborate or intricate “selfies” that would forever be frozen in time. Images that made me feel strong, powerful, <i>beautiful</i>, because I often didn’t feel that way when I was not behind a camera. Taking so many pictures until I got the <i>right</i> one because then I could look back at them and say, “ah, yes. This is what I want to see myself as. This is what I wish I looked like every second of every day.” While that little voice still pops into my head, as an almost 30-year-old woman with two kids, a changed physique, and some more wisdom, I can accept when the photo is not the “right” one. For a long time, to me, photography had often been about beauty, capturing the spectacle of aesthetics. But as much as beauty is held in high regards, photography is also about truth telling, and the beauty remains true even if the angles, lighting, and editing are not there to crutch onto.<br/></p>
 <p>The frozen forever moments are taken to capture the sparkle, or essence within us and the world around us. To represent who and what we are at that given moment, even if the outside world deems them “ugly” or “undesirable”. Whether it be a self-portrait taken by a professional, a bathroom selfie, a withering flower laying on broken, littered concrete, graffiti, the clouds in the sky, etc., there is (what I like to say) art in everything; <i>I am art, and art is me</i>. No, objects cannot literally describe or see themselves as this art I’m referring to, but as the producer of the image, I take on that role. The withering roses are themselves, naturally living the way they are, unknowing that another even recognizes them as beautiful. We as humans subscribe to that definition. And no, the roses can’t look at the image and say, “wow I feel so seen”, but does that mean they shouldn’t be seen?<br/></p>
That same sentiment goes for human beings as well. As someone who has struggled with beauty, body image, and all-around self-love, I know I am not alone in this world when it comes to those ideas. Everyone deserves to see themselves as the star of their life, the star on the front page of a magazine or billboard. As the photographer, and just another human being living in this world, I love creating that moment. The world is saturated with trauma, violence, oppression, things that are extremely difficult to deal with and move past, but at the same time, life is filled with joy, love, beauty, and reclamation. My photography and image making call on those moments, not to exploit or appropriate or diminish what is happening around us, but as a reminder to find pleasure within it and most importantly within ourselves.</p>
